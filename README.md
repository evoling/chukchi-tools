# chukchi-tools

Tools for working with Chukchi language data

Usage examples:
```
./ChukchiOrthog.py lexemes.txt

echo qoraŋə | ./ChukchiOrthog.py -c
```
There is a extensive set of unit tests:
```
./TestChukchiOrthog.py
```
If the script fails to do something properly (i) add an issue to the issue tracker and I will update the script and tests, or (ii) fix it yourself and send a pull request. If you fix it yourself please update the unit tests too.
