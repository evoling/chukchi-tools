- Add an option about what to do when a form can't be transliterated according
  to the rules (e.g.  loan morphemes): fail, return word untransliterated,
  return word flagged somehow
  --fail-policy {error|pass|tag}
- collapse IPA with morpheme breaks and possible spaces to whole Cyrillic words
  --collapse
- Spellchecker mode. Return forms which are not well-formed Chukchi words
  according to the transliteration style
- Handle Cyrillic typewriter conventions, both к' and к", н' and н" etc. (I
  think we want to handle this silently, but we only need to return normalized
  modern Cyrillic)
